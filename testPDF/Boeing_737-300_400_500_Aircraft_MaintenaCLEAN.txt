SUBJECT 00: IGNITION
74-00-00 PAGE BLOCK 0: DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION (EFFECTIVITY: 001999 ALL)
1. General

A. The ignition system (Fig. 1) consists of an engine start switch, engine igniter selector switch, 2 high energy

ignition exciters or 2 low energy ignition exciters, 2 spark igniters and 2 coaxial shielded ignition leads.

B. The purpose of the system is to produce an electrical spark to ignite the fuel and air mixture
in the engine combustion chamber during the start cycle and to provide continuous ignition
during takeoff, landing and operation in adverse weather conditions.

C. The left, right or the two spark igniters can be selected during the start cycle or

for continuous ignition operation.

D. The ignition system consists of the Ignition Power Supply, 74-11-00; High Tension

Distribution, 74-21-00; and Engine Ignition Control, 74-31-00.

WARNING: DO NOT DO A CHECK OF THE IGNITION SYSTEM WHEN YOU HAVE ONE

OF THE CONDITIONS THAT FOLLOW:
THE AIRPLANE IS IN THE HANGER,
THE AIRPLANE IS NEAR BUILDINGS OR OTHER AIRPLANES THAT ARE WITHIN THE
DANGEROUS JET-WAKE AREA FOR THE GROUND IDLE (AMM 71-00-00/201),
DURING AIRPLANE FUELING.
MAKE SURE THAT NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT ARE IN THE DANGEROUS JET-WAKE
AREA FOR THE GROUND IDLE (AMM 71-00-00/201) OF THE APPLICABLE ENGINE.
IGNITION VOLTAGE IS VERY DANGEROUS. DO NOT TOUCH THE IGNITER PLUGS, THE
ENERGIZED PART OF THE IGNITION EXCITER OR THE LEADS DURING THE OPERATION.

WARNING: USE THE PROCEDURE IN CHAPTER 71 TO OPERATE THE POWER PLANT (AMM
